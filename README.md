# Air Quality Analysis (Ozone Levels in 2020)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing air quality data using the dataset **"daily_Ozone_2020.csv"**, which contains air quality measurements collected by outdoor monitors across the United States. The primary goal is to explore trends in **ozone levels** during 2020 and gain insights into air pollution patterns.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes **daily ozone concentration measurements** from various locations in the U.S. The key features in the dataset include:
- **Date**: The recorded date of measurement.
- **Location**: The monitoring station where the data was collected.
- **Ozone Levels**: Daily ozone concentration levels (measured in parts per billion).
- **Other Factors**: Additional environmental variables that may affect air quality.
